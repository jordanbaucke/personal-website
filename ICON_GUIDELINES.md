# Icon Guidelines

## Preference Order for Icons

When adding icons to this project, follow this order of preference:

1. **Download PNG/JPG from the internet first** - Search for free, high-quality icons from reliable sources:
   - Wikimedia Commons
   - Flag CDN services (flagcdn.com, etc.)
   - Public domain image repositories
   - Free icon libraries

2. **Download SVG from the internet** - If PNG is not available, try to find an SVG version

3. **Create custom SVG only as last resort** - Only create custom SVG icons if:
   - No suitable icon can be found online
   - The icon needs to be highly customized
   - The icon is project-specific and doesn't exist elsewhere

## Notes

- Always verify licensing and ensure icons are free to use
- Prefer PNG for photos/realistic images, SVG for simple graphics
- Store all icons in the `media/` folder
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `usa-flag-icon.png` not `flag.png`)
