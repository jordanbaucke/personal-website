      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Enterprise Architecture Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/ecosystem-partners/salesforce">Accenture's Salesforce practice</a>, where I focus on applying AI to modern business information systems at scale. My work spans advising clients across health and human services, financial services, and communications, media, and technology, with an emphasis on executive-level decision support and delivery leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my primary focus is leveraging AI APIs to accelerate enterprise workflows and modernize customer relationship platforms such as <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/">Salesforce Agentforce</a>, in partnership with hyperscaler AI providers including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
        My consulting philosophy is grounded in a simple framework: Clients, People, and Practice—delivering measurable outcomes for clients, developing strong teams, and building durable technical capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The values I bring to my work are influenced by long-term business thinkers such as Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway; Harvard Law School) and Warren Buffett (Chairman & CEO, Berkshire Hathaway; Columbia Business School), whose emphasis on clarity, patience, and principled decision-making continues to shape my leadership approach.

      <blockquote>
        "There is nothing I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution." – Benjamin Franklin

      <blockquote>
        "I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. In my life, I try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad in comparison to somebody else. Bitcoin does all three. Bitcoin is probably rat poison squared." – Charlie Munger (2018 Berkshire Hathaway conference)
