# Personal Website

This is my personal website.

## About

This site was generated using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), an AI-powered code editor.

## Design Philosophy

The site is designed to be intentionally minimalistic, and to mirror the sorts of web development and tools from the time period I learned to code for the internet (2007-2008). This reflects a preference for simplicity, performance, and the foundational web technologies that shaped my early development experience.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
